        Israel’s truce with Hezbollah must be followed by ceasefire in Gaza. That’s in Israel’s interest as well
<br><br>
Israel has been fighting wars on two fronts recently. One was with a group called Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the other is with a group called Hamas in Gaza. These wars have caused a lot of destruction and suffering, so people are hoping for peace.

Israel and Hezbollah are planning to pause fighting for 60 days, which is good news. Israel has been very successful in weakening Hezbollah, even targeting their top leaders. But Hezbollah has still been firing rockets into Israel, making life dangerous and difficult for people in the north. Many had to leave their homes, and normal life has been disrupted for over a year.

Now, Israel needs this break because its military is getting tired after so many months of fighting. Also, fewer soldiers are showing up to help, and the country needs time to recover.

But the biggest problem is in Gaza, where the fighting has been even more devastating. Over 44,000 people have died, homes have been destroyed, and many families are struggling without food or medicine. Israel says it’s defending itself from Hamas, but the people in Gaza, most of whom are innocent, are suffering terribly. Stopping the war in Gaza could bring peace to the entire region because groups like Hezbollah are fighting in support of Hamas.

Lastly, there’s pressure on Israel to behave fairly because it’s a democracy. Israel has shown its strength and defended itself, but now it’s time to choose peace. This way, fewer people will suffer, and the region can start healing.
