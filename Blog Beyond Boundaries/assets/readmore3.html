        Take a tip from Muhammad bin Tughlaq for a long-term solution to Delhi-NCR pollution problem
<br><br>
With NCR once again choking in its seasonal stranglehold of smog, the Capital should take a tip from Muhammad bin Tughlaq.

History has yet to decide whether Tughlaq was a crackpot, or a genius, or a bit of both as is often the case. He was certainly way ahead of his time. Skilled in medical science and fluent in five languages, he was the first to introduce a token currency in the subcontinent as a cost-cutting measure in the form of brass and copper coins to replace those made of gold and silver and being worth an equal amount. The measure failed as widespread counterfeiting rendered the new coinage worthless.

Undeterred, Tughlaq undertook another bold experiment, and in 1327 he shifted the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad, in what is now Maharashtra. The move failed for logistical reasons, but the plan was sound, as the new location was better situated for more efficient administration besides being less vulnerable than Delhi to northern invasion.

Now NCR should follow Tughlaq’s example and transfer the Capital, as the centre of govt, to another site as a major step to reduce pollution.

The vast apparatus of governance, with its offices, residences, and fleets of vehicles adds significantly to congestion and pollution through the consumption of utilities and fossil fuel.

Short-term measures such as staggering govt working hours or resorting to WFH won’t do the trick. Get govt out of the city in toto.

Shifting the seat of governance to a remote area would not only aid in decongesting and depolluting NCR but would also bring development to a hitherto neglected backwater.

Thanks to the increasing use of e-governance at various levels, administrative work would not be hampered by geographic location.

The vacated governmental property would make Delhi’s real estate, both office space and residential, more affordable as the city got the sarkar out of its hair. And as it got govt out of its air, NCR could literally breathe easier. A truly Capital idea.
