        Means multiple political births – and as many miscarriages
<br><br>
The Great Indian Family – sequel to Big Fattening Indian Wedding – is our bestseller brand. From epics to Bollywood, it has something for everyone’s taste. Cloying togetherness and smarmy umami, but our masala-coated palates mangey more, and get it: spicy scandal, soured relationships, bitter rivalry. It’s same to same with political families. The Gandhis may be synonymous with it, but dynasty has ruled from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. And Assam to Ahmedabad too: Gogois and Sorens in east; Patels Keshubhai/Chimanlal and Thackerays/Pawars in the west. Heartland has never-ending Yadavon ki baarat. There’s a parivarvad for the entire alphabet – and to spare. Try keeping track of those bracketed with initials of breakaway founders.

Barely have we recovered from Diwali, the biggest blood-family get-together time, than in states like mine we are already into elections, bloodiest political-family get-apart time. Arre bhau, tujha ani malha family politics are like Shanti Sammelan only compared to those of neta parivars. They’re so polls apart that correct spelling should be ‘pariwar’. Well, one of them is spelt almost that way. Nephew Ajit broke away from Chacha Sharad in 2022 to become deputy CM in the new Mahayuti alliance. Ha-ha, now nephew Yugendra is pitted against Chacha Ajit.

Compared to the ongoing war of the Maharashtra cousins, that of the Mahabharata cousins was a mere brotherly spat over marbles. Uddhav and Raj Thackeray are congenitally katti. This time, Raj says his Navnirman Sena is ‘natural ally’ of ruling Mahayuti’s BJP, but his son’s candidature is not being supported by Shiv Sena, the other alliance partner. This is the Shinde-led, parted-ways party which claimed to be legit heir of Balasaheb, and replaced the latter’s son Uddhav as CM in 2022. His alliance with BJP had made Eknath then look like Do-nath.

Despite viscerally hating Dynasty, BJP is perforce backing parivarvad candidates aplenty. But its own do naths can tightly control disaffected members. Godfather RSS also helps. Indeed our powerful Hindutva Family too is held together by a code of silence: Om-erta.
