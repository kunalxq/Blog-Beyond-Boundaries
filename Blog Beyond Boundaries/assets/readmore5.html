        Soren’s aced the politics, it is governance he needs to improve
<br><br>
Will Hemant Soren turn out to be a cat with nine political lives? Jharkhand has returned him to office, a rare CM on bail. Soren’s had a tumultuous stint since his 2019 win – among the first CMs to get private sector help to fly back his state’s migrants to Ranchi, using Twitter to have three-way conversations with migrant groups and destination-state CMs. By Sep 2022, he was forced into a waiting game over EC’s opinion on Soren’s “disqualification” in connection with an office-of-profit case. By Jan 2024, he was in ED custody, arrested in a PMLA case. Soren’s a nonconformist CM and won again on the strength of his party’s politics, and a state tradition of resistance. Jharkhand’s CMship has always been torrid – since 2000, seven politicians have served as CM 13 times, and there’ve been three central rule periods.

Soren must use some of his political savvy and administrative calibre to improve people’s lives. Jharkhand still has 30% of its population multidimensionally poor. It has among the country’s worst electricity crises despite it being home to over 140 coal mines and seven thermal plants – almost all power is sent outside the state. Its per capita income, among India’s lowest, is almost 300% less than Goa’s, the richest on per capita income. The problem with Jharkhand, and to a lesser extent twin state Chhattisgarh, is that the very issues that crippled the state at inception endure – progress is painfully slow as much on education and health as in jobs, or income generation. Smaller states were carved out ostensibly to better manage their governance. But that’s been proved otherwise. Jharkhand’s miners – 7.5L formally employed and 30L informal workers – are trapped in their work with no improvement in circumstance. Companies are rich, netas are rich, the people and the govt poor.

The two tribal land laws that protect Chotanagpur and Santhal Pargana regions ensure no land transfer. But protection of tribal autonomy cannot mean a state failing the people. For, tribals do not even have the money for input costs of farming their land. Surely, schemes to support agriculture by tribals are a no-brainer. Cooperatives among tribal communities have been mooted for self-sufficiency. The Supreme Court has said legislative power to tax mineral rights vests with the states, that royalty paid on minerals was not a tax. But, question is, will the state spend funds thus generated on its people?
