        Aravalis to Goa, govts seem determined to ignore the Wayanad lesson
       <br><br>
        In different parts of India, like the Aravali hills and Goa, the government is making decisions that might hurt nature. They’re not learning from what happened in Wayanad, where landslides caused a lot of damage.
        
        In Haryana, there was a mix-up. One part of the government said some land in the Aravali hills should be protected. But another part sold some of this land for mining. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. The government often chooses to listen to people who want to build or mine instead of those who want to protect nature.
        
        In Goa, they’re changing rules to make it easier to build houses and businesses on land that used to be protected. This could be dangerous because it might cause landslides and destroy farms and forests. Some people think the government is doing this to help rich and powerful people, not everyone.
        
        What happened in Wayanad shows why this is so important. Goa has similar land to Wayanad, so it could have the same problems if they’re not careful. Building too much in areas that are easily damaged by nature is always a bad idea, but it’s even worse now because of climate change.
        
        In both Goa and Haryana, not taking care of nature has caused problems. In Goa, mining has made water dirty and hurt the soil. In Haryana, destroying parts of the Aravali hills has caused problems with water and made the air quality worse in nearby areas.
        
        The government says they care about nature and climate change, but their actions don’t always show this. It’s important for them to start making choices that actually protect the environment, not just say they will.
